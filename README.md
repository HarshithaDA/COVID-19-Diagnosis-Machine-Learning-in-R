# COVID-19-Diagnosis-Machine-Learning-in-R

This project uses statistical methods to preprocess and analyze a blood sample dataset and implements a Random Forest model, a supervised machine learning algorithm to determine if a person has COVID-19 or not. The dataset includes different blood parameters that have been identified as potential indicators of COVID-19 infection, and their analysis can help in the diagnosis of the disease.
