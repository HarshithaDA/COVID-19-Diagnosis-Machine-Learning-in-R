# COVID-19-Diagnosis-Machine-Learning-in-R

This project aims to use Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm and statistical methods to analyze a blood sample dataset and determine if a person has COVID-19 or not. The dataset includes different blood parameters that have been identified as potential indicators of COVID-19 infection, and their analysis can help in the diagnosis of the disease.
